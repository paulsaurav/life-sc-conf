            ABOUT ICAR Regional Center for NEH Region, Mizoram
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-800 text-md font-medium mt-1 text-justify">
            The ICAR Research Complex for North Eastern Hill (NEH) Region,
            Mizoram Centre, located in Kolasib, was established in May 1975 to
            address the agricultural research needs of the state. As a regional
            unit of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), it plays
            a pivotal role in advancing sustainable farming practices tailored
            to the unique agro-climatic conditions of Mizoram. <br />
            The Centre's research initiatives encompass a wide array of
            disciplines, including crop science, horticulture, animal husbandry,
            fisheries, and natural resource management. A notable achievement is
            the development and promotion of organic farming systems, aligning
            with Mizoram's status as an organic state. The Centre has also been
            instrumental in introducing improved crop varieties and livestock
            breeds suited to the region's specific requirements. <br />
            In addition to research, the Mizoram Centre actively engages in
            extension activities to disseminate knowledge and technologies to
            farmers. It organizes events such as Kisan Melas, where farmers are
            introduced to innovative agricultural practices and provided with
            necessary inputs. For instance, during the Kisan Mela-2022, the
            Centre distributed agricultural tools and Vanaraja chicks to
            selected farmers, emphasizing the importance of integrated farming
            systems. <br />
            The Centre also collaborates with various stakeholders, including
            state agricultural departments and other research institutions, to
            enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability in Mizoram.
            Through these collaborative efforts, the ICAR Research Complex for
            NEH Region, Mizoram Centre continues to contribute significantly to
            the agricultural development of the state.
